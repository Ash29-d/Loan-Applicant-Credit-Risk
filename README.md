# Loan-Applicant-Credit-Risk


## Overview

This project aims to predict the credit risk of loan applicants using a machine learning model. It leverages the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify applicants based on their likelihood of repaying credit. By identifying high-risk individuals, financial institutions can make informed lending decisions, reducing defaults and enhancing profitability.


## Features

  * Data Preprocessing:
     * Handled missing values and scaled numerical data.
     * Encoded categorical features using suitable techniques.
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
     * Visualized correlations and distributions of key features.
     * Performed analysis to understand relationships between variables and credit risk.
  * Machine Learning Model:
     * Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification.
     * Optimized hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.
  * Model Evaluation:
     * Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
     * Visualized performance metrics using confusion matrices.


## How It Works
 
  * Data Preparation:
     * Load the dataset and clean it to remove inconsistencies.
     * Transform and scale data for better model performance.
  * Model Training:
     * Train the KNN model on the processed dataset.
     * Experiment with hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
  * Prediction:
     * Use the trained model to classify new applicants as low or high credit risk.
  * Evaluation:
     * Evaluate the modelâ€™s predictive performance using validation data.
  * Insights:
     * Generate insights to support decision-making for loan approvals.
